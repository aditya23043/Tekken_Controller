# One Handed Controller for playing games
- Currently targeting right handed controller and for Tekken because it needs lesser buttons than games like GTA V or CS GO

## Prototype 1
- All files are inside the `prototype_1/` directory

### Shortcomings
- Screw mounting holes are not in the correct place in the bottom plate
- The gap between adjacent switches is not large enough for the keycaps to fit in

### Learnings
- Metal standoffs are enough to hold the top plate rigidly without any visible bending
